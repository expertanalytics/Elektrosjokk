# Cressman simulation with stimulation

## Initial Conditions

The initial conditions are from the code I got from Andre

## Boundary conditions

The boundary conditions are homogeneous Neumann, except for where the forcing is applied.

### Forcing

The forcing term is the same as in the matlab code. It is the solution to a system of ODEs.
